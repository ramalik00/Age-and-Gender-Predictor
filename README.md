# Age-and-Gender-Predictor
## Age and Gender Predictor using Opencv and Python.
#### The Caffe models used here for predicting age and gender have been trained by Gil Levi and Tal Hassner . Link to their work : https://talhassner.github.io/home/publication/2015_CVPR
    1. Clone the repository in your local machine
    2. The files will include face_detector,age_detector and gender_detector Caffe based models
    3. Run the detect_video.py file from your terminal
    4. Use the following command line arguments for mask_detector.py:
           • --input <filename> 
           • --output <file_name_save> to save the output after detection on input file
           • If no input is provided then your default webcam will be used 
    5. When using detect_image.py only use --input command to provide path for input image
